# 🌀 QMaze-The-Quantum-Path-Explorer ⚛️🚀

Welcome to the **Quantum Maze Visualizer** — a captivating simulation of quantum computing principles using Java Swing!  
Watch as *virtual qubits* 🌐 explore all possible paths of a maze **in parallel** and find the most efficient route at lightning speed ⚡.

## ✨ Features

✅ **Quantum-inspired path exploration**  
✅ **Multiple paths explored in parallel**  
✅ **Qubits multiply exponentially 🔁 until the exit is found**  
✅ **Each qubit has a limited lifespan ⏳ (decoherence)**  
✅ **The first successful path is instantly marked in 💜 purple**  
✅ **Clean GUI made with Java Swing 🎨**  
✅ **Graceful exit after showcasing the found path 👋**

## 🗺️ How It Works

- The maze is a **10×10 grid**
- The start point is **Green 🟩 (0,0)** and the end point is **Red 🟥 (9,9)**
- Qubits (cyan circles 🔵) move in 4 possible directions: **Up, Down, Left, Right**
- Each move creates multiple new qubits — simulating quantum parallelism ⚛️
- If a qubit reaches the exit:
  - 🎉 The path it took is highlighted in **Purple**
  - All other qubits vanish ✨
  - The program waits 3 seconds and exits gracefully

## 🎯 Why This Project?

Quantum computing can simultaneously explore multiple paths and solutions — unlike classical computing. This visualizer mimics that behavior using Java, letting students and developers visualize the power of quantum parallelism in a fun and interactive way! Although the time in this program is not actually exponential as it is in Java but definitely you will get the visualization.
